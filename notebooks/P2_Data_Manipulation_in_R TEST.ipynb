Tabular data is commonly stored in text files such as CSV, or on spreadsheets; and explicitly spatial data will likely be stored in formats such as Shapefiles. In this section you will learn how to read data stored in these formats into R.\n\n### Reading Tabular Data\n\nA common way in which data can be stored externally are the the use of .csv files. These are text files, and have a very simple format where columns of attributes are separated by a comma [^1], and each row by a carriage return. \n\n[^1]: There are a range of different delimiter which can be used in addition to a comma, with the most common being tab; although sometimes characters not commonly used such as bar (|) will be used.\n\nIn the following example you will read in some U.S. Census Bureau, 2010-2014 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimate data. This was downloaded from the [American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov) website. The data are for census tracts in San Francisco and relate to median earnings in the past 12 months.\n\nReading CSV files into R uses the read.csv() function:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Read CSV file - creates a data frame called earnings\nearnings <- read.csv(\"./data/ACS_14_5YR_S2001_with_ann.csv\")\n\n#Show column headings\ncolnames(earnings)\n\n#UID - Tract ID\n#pop - estimated total population over 16 with income\n#pop_m - estimated total population over 16 with income (margin of error)\n#earnings - estimated median earnings\n#earnings - estimated median earnings (margin of error)\n","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is possible to show the structure of the object using the str() function.\n<a id=\"earnings\"></a>","metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":0}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"str(earnings)","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This shows that the object is a data frame with 197 rows and 5 variables. For each of the attributes the class is shown (num = numeric; int = integer and Factor, with the number of levels). The read.csv() function guesses the column types when the data are read into R.\n\nOne issue you might notice is that the earnings and earnings_m variables have been read in as a Factor. The reason these columns were not read as integers (like the pop and pop_m) is the presence of two non-numeric values which are shown as \"*\" and \"-\". In ACS data these two symbols indicate that the sample sizes were either no sample observations or too few sample observations to make a calculation.\n\nIssues such as these are quite common when reading in external data; and we will look at how this can be corrected later.\n\nNot all tabular data are distributed as textfiles, and another very common format is Microsoft Excel format - .xls or xlsx.
